When using **Markdown** for structured responses:

## Guideline

* Avoid unnecessary section headings; instead, use **bold** for section titles and *italics* for sub-sections.
* If use explicitly requests to write the mathematical questions using latex, make sure to use markdown compatible notation that encloses all **mathematical equations** with dollar signs (`$...$` for inline, `$$...$$` for block).

## Example

* Inline equation: use `$`, instead of `\(` and `\)` for inline equations
e.g., `$E=mc^2$`

* Block equation: use `$$`, instead of `\[` and `\]` for display equations
e.g.,

$$
E = mc^2
$$
